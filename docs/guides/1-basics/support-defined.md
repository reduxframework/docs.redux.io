# Getting Help: Our Support Defined
We've included this document in order to help everyone understand what we will and will not support. Please read it carefully and 
with understanding as we wish to truly convey our intent to help.

### Who are we?
We maintain an open source project entitled Redux Framework. It is used by millions of of users across in all walks of life all across the 
world. Redux is used primarily by developers. That means if users of our developers 
approach us for help, it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to provide the requested support.

### Why is that?
Redux is built for developers. A basic to moderate understanding of PHP, error logs, and JavaScript bugs is required.  It is impossible 
for us to provide solutions to those without the experience of coding in these spaces. We mean no disrespect, but often times it 
takes us five times longer to explain a standard developer concept to a non-developer.

### But I'm a user, does that mean I'm out of luck?!
Not entirely.  We want to help.  We really do.  We simply need to be compensated for our time. Not only are we debugging a 
potential problem in OUR code, but also need to debug a problem within another developer's code to help. To do this, we 
need you to support our project by paying for premium support.

### But that's not fair!
It’s also not fair that your developer may have stopped supporting you.  We sympathize.  However, we'll be required to find out 
exactly what your developer was doing and that takes a LOT of time on our part. We need to charge for that service. 
Solving problems in third party applications that utilize Redux takes us away from our means as well as time spent 
making Redux better.

### Truly, we want to help!
We truly do want to help!  But at the end of the day we can't offer unlimited support for circumstances beyond our control.

### Best of Luck!
We genuinely wish you best of luck.  We're not attempting to insult. We will gladly solve problems in our code but we cannot
solve problems in another developers code without compensation.

### I still want support!
If you're still interested in support from us, you need to start by [generating a support hash](generating-a-support-hash.md). 
Please do not be disappointed if we inform you that we require a purchase of [premium support](https://redux.io/extensions/premium-support) 
for us to further assist you if your problem is outside of the scope of our framework.
