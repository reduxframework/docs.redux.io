# Framework Converter
We've created a conversion utility to make conversion from a different options framework easier.  It allows you to play 
with Redux and convert data from other input frameworks.

Currently supported frameworks:

- [Slightly Modified Options Framework (SMOF)](https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework) 
- [Option Tree](https://wordpress.org/plugins/option-tree/)
